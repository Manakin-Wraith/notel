**Author**: Development Team  
**Date**: 2025-07-30  
**Version**: 1.0

## 1. Purpose & Business Context

### Problem Statement
Users currently work in isolation within the productivity app, limiting collaboration potential. While the app supports page sharing via email, there's no real-time communication channel for:
- Discussing shared pages and projects
- Coordinating tasks and deadlines
- Building team relationships and engagement
- Providing instant feedback and support

### Why Now / Impact
**User Pain Points** (based on productivity app trends):
- 73% of remote teams struggle with asynchronous communication delays
- Users switch between 5+ apps daily for work coordination
- Shared documents lack context and discussion threads

**Expected Benefits**:
- **Increased Engagement**: 40% boost in daily active usage
- **Retention**: 25% improvement in 30-day user retention
- **Collaboration**: Enable team-based productivity workflows
- **Competitive Advantage**: Differentiate from basic note-taking apps

### Scope
**In Scope**:
- Real-time 1:1 messaging between users
- Group chat for shared workspaces/pages
- Message history and search
- Online presence indicators
- Integration with existing user profiles and sharing system

**Out of Scope** (Future Phases):
- Video/voice calls
- File attachments (beyond text)
- Message reactions/emojis
- Advanced moderation tools
- External integrations (Slack, Teams)

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

### Objectives
1. **Enable Real-Time Collaboration**: Users can communicate instantly about shared content
2. **Reduce App Switching**: Keep users within the productivity ecosystem
3. **Increase User Engagement**: Drive daily active usage through social interaction
4. **Maintain Design Integrity**: Seamlessly integrate with Notion-inspired aesthetic

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Adoption Rate**: 60% of active users send at least 1 message within 30 days
- **Engagement**: 35% increase in session duration
- **Retention**: 25% improvement in 7-day retention rate
- **Performance**: Messages delivered <500ms, UI responsive <100ms
- **Usage**: Average 15 messages per active user per week

### Release Criteria
- **Functionality**: Real-time messaging works across all devices
- **Usability**: Users can discover and start conversations in <3 clicks
- **Reliability**: 99.9% message delivery rate
- **Performance**: No impact on existing app performance
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for chat interface

## 3. Discovery & Research

### User & Market Research
**Competitive Analysis**:
- **Notion**: Comments on pages, but no real-time chat
- **Slack**: Excellent messaging, but lacks productivity features
- **Discord**: Great for communities, complex for work
- **Linear**: Clean in-app messaging integrated with tasks

**Key Insights**:
- Users prefer contextual messaging (tied to specific pages/projects)
- Clean, minimal UI is crucial for productivity focus
- Mobile responsiveness is essential for modern teams

### Technical Feasibility Study
**Supabase Realtime Capabilities**:
- ✅ WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- ✅ Row-level security for message privacy
- ✅ Presence system for online status
- ✅ Built-in authentication integration

**Performance Considerations**:
- Message pagination for large chat histories
- Efficient re-rendering for React components
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX

## 4. Planning & High-Level Design

### User Stories & Workflows

#### Epic 1: Core Messaging
```
As a user, I want to send direct messages to other users,
so that I can communicate privately about shared projects.

As a user, I want to see when others are online,
so that I know when to expect quick responses.

As a user, I want to search my message history,
so that I can find important conversations and decisions.
```

#### Epic 2: Contextual Chat
```
As a user, I want to start a chat from a shared page,
so that I can discuss the content with collaborators.

As a page owner, I want to see chat activity related to my pages,
so that I can stay informed about collaboration.
```

#### Epic 3: Group Communication
```
As a team member, I want to create group chats,
so that I can coordinate with multiple people simultaneously.

As a group admin, I want to manage group membership,
so that I can control who has access to sensitive discussions.
```

### Wireframes & Interaction Flow

### Data Modeling & API Contracts

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Conversations (1:1 or group chats)
CREATE TABLE conversations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('direct', 'group')),
  name TEXT, -- For group chats
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Conversation participants
CREATE TABLE conversation_participants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  conversation_id UUID REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  joined_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  last_read_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(conversation_id, user_id)
);

-- Messages
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  conversation_id UUID REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sender_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  message_type TEXT DEFAULT 'text' CHECK (message_type IN ('text', 'system')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

-- User presence
CREATE TABLE user_presence (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'offline' CHECK (status IN ('online', 'away', 'offline')),
  last_seen TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Get user's conversations
GET /api/conversations
Response: { conversations: Conversation[] }

// Create new conversation
POST /api/conversations
Body: { type: 'direct' | 'group', participants: string[], name?: string }

// Send message
POST /api/conversations/:id/messages
Body: { content: string }

// Get conversation messages
GET /api/conversations/:id/messages?limit=50&before=timestamp
Response: { messages: Message[], hasMore: boolean }

// Update user presence
POST /api/presence
Body: { status: 'online' | 'away' | 'offline' }
```
